# GoFateInjector

A sh*tty replica of Fate Injector written in Go because why not!

**Note: This injector is not associated with bigrat.monster website. I put bigrat.monster in "Made by bigrat.monster" as a joke**

# Why

1. Cuz I am a crackhead
2. I want to make the first Go injector that have gui (public) so I choose to replica Fate Injector with Win32 gui from Windigo!
